# 📚 Matrix Library

The library was created for the purpose of web development for quick and easy calculations with matrices and numbers. The matrix is ​​capable of any operations, and the instructions describe in detail what each one does and how it works.

# 📖 HOW TO USE

## IMPORTING LIBRARY

import { mul, sum, sub, trans, det } from "path";

**Download and extract ZIP!** Paste the code at the beginning of the file in which you intend to use the functions. Instead of path, write where the main matrix.js file is located.

## FUNCTIONS

- **mul(a,b)** -> Multiply matrices or numbers in the order a * b.
- **sum(a,b)** -> Summing matrices or numbers in order a + b.
- **sub(a,b)** -> Subtracts matrices or numbers in order a - b.
- **trans(matrix)** -> Transposes a matrix.
- **det(matrix)** -> Determines the determinant of a matrix.

# ❗**IMPORTANT**❗

A and B can be arrays and matrices. So anything is possible. Depending on the input, the result can be either an array or a number.

For example, if both variables are a number, the result will be a number, but if at least one of the variables is an array, the result will be an array.
