# 📖 HOW TO USE

## IMPORTING LIBRARY

import { mul, sum, sub, trans, det } from "path";

**Download and extract ZIP!** Paste the code at the beginning of the file in which you intend to use the functions. Instead of path, write where the main matrix.js file is located.

## FUNCTIONS

- **mul(a,b)** -> Multiply matrices in the order a * b.
- **sum(a,b)** -> Summing matrices or numbers a + b.
- **sub(a,b)** -> Subtracts matrices or numbers a - b.
- **trans(matrix)** -> Transposes a matrix.
- **det(matrix)** -> Determines the determinant of a matrix.

# ❗**IMPORTNAT**❗

A and B can be and arrays and matrices. Depends on result you will get in return, it can be array or number.
